### Special Thanks

I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to [Jacob](https://github.com/aarthificial) for creating Motion Canvas, the tool that made these videos possible. üôå A huge thank you as well to all the contributors and maintainers who‚Äôve poured their time and effort into this project.

And I can't say enough about the Motion Canvas [Discord community](https://chat.motioncanvas.io/). It‚Äôs been a welcoming space where I could ask questions, get feedback, and see the fantastic work others are doing.

Thank you for checking out the source code of my videos! üòä

#### Note

I'm still learning Motion Canvas, and this project reflects my early journey. The code here may not follow the best practices‚ÄîI've added quite a lot of lines to each scene, which probably isn't the most efficient way to structure it.

I‚Äôd love to hear any advice you have! Please feel free to share any tips or suggestions for improving the code, optimizing the animation flow, or even enhancing the overall video production. I‚Äôm eager to learn and improve.

Whether you have feedback, questions, or just want to say hi, I would love to [hearüìß](mailto:priyanshu@priyanshusharma.dev) from you‚ú®.
